/**
 * The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold and italic text,
 * as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages.
 * Telegram clients will render them accordingly.
 * You can use either markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.
 *
 * Note:
 * that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before
 * opening an inline link (‘Open this link?’ together with the full URL).
 *
 * Note:
 * Tags must not be nested.
 * All numerical HTML entities are supported.
 * Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.
 * All <, > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the
 * corresponding HTML entities (< with &lt;, > with &gt; and & with &amp;).
 * The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot;.
